# Architect-Project-1

To learn arm assembly, writing in arm, troubleshooting arm, building, and so on

# Sub Project 1 Control Structure
* Code up a C/C++ Goto statement
* Code up if then else statement, use the goto statement you just in the solution 
** ( I used the goto to get the number 3!)
* Code up a x thenbody : else body
* Code up a do while condition

# Non-Recursive Merge Sort
* implement the non-recursive merge sort for powers of two 
* you will need to print out the sort and unsorted lists. You must use the control structures you coded up in sub project 1

## Testing 
* for lists of 16,32,128
* provide a test case of length 16 (if any) which takes the fewest cycles
* provide a test case of length 16 (if any) which takes the most cycles

# Sub Project 3 Recursive Merge Sort 
Using the Merge sort and the control structures coded up in sub project 1 repeat the testing of sub problem 2 for the recursive merge sort
